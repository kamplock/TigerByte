This project is by Kamryn Plock (@kamplock) and Olivia Navarro (@olivianavarro) during the 2023-2024 school year as a Senior Capstone Project at Doane University.

As we are in the planning and initial development stages, this README will be updated with the appropriate tech stack at a later date. Here is our current tech stack: MongoDB, C#, HTML, & CSS.

Here is our project pitch: Navigating through a large binder filled with hundreds of pages can be less than ideal, particularly when searching for specific problem sets related to distinct data structures, varying difficulty levels, or certain names. To address this challenge, we've developed TigerByte, tailored specifically for the Doane Programming Team.

The Doane Programming Team required a more efficient means of accessing these problem sets to prevent them from collecting dust for extended periods, only resurfacing during competitions. This website aims to resolve this issue, providing programming students with a more user-friendly interface for engaging with these problems and enhancing their overall learning experience.
