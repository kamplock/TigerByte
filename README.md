## TigerByte
This project is by [Kamryn Plock](https://github.com/kamplock/) and [Olivia Navarro](https://github.com/olivianavarro/) during the 2023-2024 school year as a Senior Capstone Project at Doane University.

## Current Tech Stack 
* MongoDB
* C#
* ASP.NET Web API
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* The Bootstrap framework

Note: This project is solely intended for educational purposes and should not be used for any commercial or unauthorized activities. All content provided is for informational and educational purposes only. In software development, security is vital. Companies creating full-stack applications often have a dedicated team for securing their APIs and applications. As two emerging software developers, we've gained valuable knowledge, yet realize there's much more to explore. We acknowledge the potential to enhance the security of our code, but doing so may jeopardize the requirements set for the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) established at the beginning of the 2023 school year.

## Project Pitch
As members of the Doane Programming Team, we are developing a full-stack web application for our Senior Capstone Project. The application will allow current and future team members to practice different types of skills needed for competitions with problems from a physical binder that is only pulled out at competitions. By addressing the need for efficient access to programming problem sets, TigerByte not only prevents these physical resources from stagnating but also offers students a more accessible and rewarding learning experience. We hope to have this project complete or mostly completed by January 2024.

## Our Requirements
1. Create a database with 2 collections in MongoDB.
2. Ensure that we can use the CRUD operations on the collections in C#.
3. Use a REST API to test the CRUD operations with Postman.
4. Enable users to find problems based on filter criteria.
5. Create a front end prototype that is secure, accessible, and responsive.
6. Enable users to login as a general user and the coach as admin.
7. Show the first 5 easy problems for users not logged in.

Final note: Due to multiple errors in our older code, we had to recreate this project using an ASP.NET Web API template in VS using .NET 8. This got our project to work, but we had to force push the new code, which overwrote the older code in this repo. This is why there is a short commit history, but there is more history in the API branch.
